											crypto market,

											strategically investing a percentage of the marketing
											wallet into a combination of risk-adjusted yield-bearing
											assets, including but not limited to stable coin staking,
											blue-chip NFTs, large and medium cap altcoins as well as
											fractionalized NFT shares. Profits generated are
											inherently reintroduced back into the project in the form
											of marketing spend and tremendous $SHARK buybacks.
